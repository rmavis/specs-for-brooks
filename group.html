				<p>A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a traditional user interface for the Unix operating system and for Unix-like systems. Users direct the operation of the computer by entering commands as text for a command line interpreter to execute, or by creating text scripts of one or more such commands. Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal emulator, however, direct operation via serial hardware connections, or networking session, are common for server systems.</p>

				<p>The most influential Unix shells have been the Bourne shell and the C shell, These shells have both been used as the coding base and model for many derivative and work-alike shells with extended feature sets.</p>
				<p>The Bourne shell, sh, was written by Stephen Bourne at AT&amp;T as the original Unix command line interpreter; it introduced the basic features common to all the Unix shells, including piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, control structures for condition-testing and looping and filename wildcarding. The language, including the use of a reversed keyword to mark the end of a block, was influenced by ALGOL 68.</p>
